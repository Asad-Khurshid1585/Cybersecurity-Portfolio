## Executive Summary
This project implements a comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation (VA&RE) system. It provides end-to-end vulnerability management, including:
- Automated data collection from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- Network scanning and vulnerability discovery
- Machine learning-based severity classification (BERT)
- Automated, context-aware remediation suggestions
- Web-based dashboard and REST API for user interaction

## System Architecture
The system is modular, with the following core components:

|----------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| `/api/scan`                     | POST   | Initiate network vulnerability scan         |
| `/api/vulnerabilities`          | GET    | Retrieve vulnerability info (with filters)  |
| `/api/remediation/<id>`         | GET    | Get remediation for a specific vulnerability|
| `/api/statistics`               | GET    | Vulnerability statistics and distributions  |
| `/api/nvd/search`               | GET    | Search NVD database                         |
| `/api/chat`                     | POST   | Interact with local LLM for assistance      |

## Data Flow
1. **Vulnerability Data Collection:**
   - NVD data via `fetch_nvd.py`
   - Network scan data via `scanner_interface.py`
   - All data normalized and stored
2. **Data Processing & Classification:**
   - Severity classifier processes vulnerability data
   - Results attached to records; statistics generated
3. **Remediation Generation:**
   - Remediation generator provides contextual steps
4. **User Interaction:**
   - Web dashboard for management, statistics, and chat

## Implementation Highlights
- **Intelligent OS Detection:**
  - Advanced fingerprinting, legacy system support
- **Machine Learning Integration:**
